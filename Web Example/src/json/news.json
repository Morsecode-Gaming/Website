We killed Garrosh pre-nerf and got Mythic Garrosh pre-WoD. Moving into WoD however we plan on a few changes to push us into competitive raid progression:<ol><li>We will be revamping our raiding schedule and hosting two teams:<ul><li>Core Progression Team (T/W/Th 7:30-10:30 CST)</li><li>Secondary Team (Su/M 7:00-10:00 CST)</li></ul></li><li>Raid rules and etiquette will be more strictly enforced in WoD.</li><li>We will (hopefully) be starting organized PvP.</li><li>Guild rank overhaul.</li></ol>For a more in-depth discussion on planned WoD changes and our reasonings click <u>here</u>."

Good job everyone and congratulations to <b>Saphstar-Icecrown</b> and <b>Kimjungun-Icecrown</b> on their Iron Juggernauts. Thanks as well to everyone from Fierce Creatures and the Icecrown/Malygos server for helping out. I look forward to more progression raiding in WoD."
