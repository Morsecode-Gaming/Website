		<h1>About the Guild</h1>
		<p>&lt;South of Heaven&gt; is a PvE-oriented semi-hardcore raiding guild on the Anvilmar-Undermine server operating mostly in Central/Eastern time. We field 2 raid teams, one mythic progression team raiding 3 nights a week for 3 hours a night, and a secondary heroic team raiding 2 nights a week for 2.5 hours a night. We also will host fun events, achievement runs and other guild affairs. We do not currently have organized guild PvP but it is on the WoD roadmap.</p>
		<br />
		
		<h3>Guild History</h3>
		<p>&lt;South of Heaven&gt; has been on Anvilmar since 2008, originally formed under the name of Helter Skelter during Naxx-era WotLK. We have been actively raiding for every tier since then with the exception of T14 and T15 in MoP peaking at #8 for server progression during T11.</p>

		<h1>Guild Rules</h1>
		<h3>General Rules</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Our guild is a family. Treat your fellow guildies like it.</li>
			<li>Do not instigate drama. If you have issues bring them to an officer and we will address them</li>
			<li>Do not ask for promotions. When the officers see potential in someone we will approach you about a promotion. Asking for one is a surefire way to NOT get promoted.</li>
			<li>Do not beg in guild. Ask politely and someone will almost always be willing to help you.</li>
			<li>Do not swindle or in anyway take advantage of people in guild. This includes over-charging for items, purposefully mis-informing, ninjaing, etc...</li>
			<li>Do not abuse the guild bank. It is there and available for everyone to use, but please contribute back!</li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		<h3>Raiding Rules</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Sign up for any raids you plan on attending on the calendar. If you don't your spot WILL NOT be reserved for you.</li>
			<li>Show up for raids at LEAST 15 minutes in advance. The group will start forming 10 mintues prior to raid start. If you are not on your spot will be filled.</li>
			<li>If you sign up it is for the ENTIRE 3 hour raid unless otherwise noted. Bailing early will compromise your spot in the future.</li>
			<li>There will be frequent breaks (every hour or so). Try and limit any AFKing you need to do to these times.</li>
			<li>Come prepared with flasks and potions for the full 3 hours (at least 3 flasks and 20 potions). There will almost always be reserves of these in the guild bank for you to take from.</li>
			<li>Feasts will be provided for all raids (core and secondary).</li>
			<li>Keep your character up to date and raid-ready. Don't come to raids with unenchanted/ungemmed gear or missing glyphs/talents.</li>
			<li>It is YOUR job to remain knowledgable on your character/class. Veterans and officers are always willing to help out, but you need to show the initiative and seek THEM out.</li>
			<li>Come focused and prepared to raid. Keep vent chatter to a minimum during boss fights and explanations.</li>
			<li><b>We are not unreasonable and realize this is, first and foremost, a video game. Real life situations will always be taken into account.</b></li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		
		<h3>Loot Rules</h3>
		<p><b>Our core team uses a main-before-off roll system.</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>One main-spec win per raid lockout. You may, however, roll main-spec again if no one else needs the loots.</li>
			<li>Unlimited off-spec wins per raid lockout.</li>
			<li>Unused BoE's go to the guild banker.</li>
			<li>Any disenchanted materials go to the guild bank/enchanter.</li> 
		</ul>
		<br />
		<p><b>Our secondary team uses personal loot.</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Guild Enchanter's Studies are available for disenchanting unused items if you are not an enchanter yourself. Please make sure some of the shards go to the guild bank.</li>
		</ul>
